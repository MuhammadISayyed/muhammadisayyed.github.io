If you’ve been in marketing long enough, you probably recognize the existence of many kinds of marketers. Aside from being categorized by specializations (performance, creative, brand, etc…), we can categorize them by how they approach a marketing problem. In such a case 2 primary categories exist. Category #1 is the domain-dependent marketer and category #2 is the discovery-led marketer.

Domain-dependent marketers are those who see a problem through the lens of their domain. So if you’re in SEO, every marketing problem you try to solve is predestined to have something do with SEO somehow. And so a domain-dependent marketer fictionizes a scenario where his tool brings about a positive impact on the business and solves its problem.

On the other hand, a discovery-led marketer has no affiliation to a specific domain over the others. You may know enough SEO to be dangerous, but not too much to not know copywriting, brand building and performance. You approach a problem with a curious mind, a well-nurtured intuition and a desire to use whatever tools that suit the situation and serve the business the most.

Differentiating between being domain-dependent and discovery-led is of utmost importance. The reason for it being so is how we, then, perceive reality. It’s become common knowledge now that when we’re inclined to something, we gather all the evidence pieces that help us prove our inclination. If you believe that performance marketing is always the solution, then you’ll never perceive reality as it is, because you’ll only care for the bits upon which you can establish a compelling argument for doing performance. You’ll subconsciously ignore evidence. You’ll misperceive possibilities as realities. And you’ll supercharge your tool with abilities it fundamentally lacks.

Now with AI becoming the official facilitator of getting technical tasks done be it in marketing or any other industry, one can easily imagine a near future where the act of writing an ad, building a FB campaign or analyzing a dataset becomes easier to the level where one person can do almost all of such tasks efficiently.

In such a future the need for the discovery-led marketer increases exponentially. In a world where it’s easy to get around a task, a strategic mindset that’s supported by analytical capabilities and good taste is what distinguishes a good marketer from a mediocre one.

This article was supposed to be an intro to a new series about how a discovery-led marketer may approach the wild land of research. But it has emerged to be an argument in favor of freeing ourselves from the shackles of over-speciality in an age where it’s easier than ever.

So I’ll consider it a preface to the series and get to writing the real intro real soon, Insh’Allah.
