First month of college was wild. A whole new world where many social limitations were magically swept away and new patterns emerged. One pattern I remember vividly these days is how I got addicted to Facebook, the official sponsor of college communication.

First year of college is a discovery phase, a very rapid one. It’s like speed dating but for groups. You meet a group of people, see if you like them and you make a decision to be part of it or not. Now with Facebook, things worked a little bit differently.

You go to college and you notice people. Just remember their faces. And then you go home and send a friend request to every single one of them. You get to discover the groups much faster. Now that I ponder it, college groups liked to show off their “group-ness”. A lot of photos, many tags & mentions, etc… And individuals needed to demonstrate how they’re so worthy of being part of a group.

This lead to a publishing race. Everyone had to say something —or else, you’re alone.

Now compare this to how things were done before college (also before social media was really a thing). We used to take our time and get to know people around us. Group changes were minimal. And we depended on real-world interactions to form our opinions about people. This is natural, and the best thing about it is that there’s no urge to talk unless you have something to say.

The world we live in today is like the college community, but 10x more stupid. Today’s default is to talk mindlessly, do the most stupid things to grab people’s attention and keep showing up consistently so that you may get lucky one day and your ass gets wider reach and more views than the asses of the masses.

The paradigm shift is clear: _previously we used to only talk if we have something to say; now we open our mouths and move our tongues and then think of something to say. Anything goes…_

## Riding a Wave

That’s not the worst thing about the current state of affairs. This is worse: people are now trained to riding trends. If you get lucky and got many views, you gotta keep doing it. It’s the opportunity of a lifetime. Don’t let people forget you. Say something, anything. Say a dump, aggressive or awful thing or say goodbye to reach and fame.

So instead of trying to be better at anything, we’re now looking for the next trend wave to ride towards being some kind of influencer. It doesn’t even take a human to ride a wave anymore. Now you can create an AI influencer, train it to ride a wave and make a lot of money out of it. Very soon, we could create an AI world where AI people are more important than the real ones.

If you’re somehow into media / show / ads businesses, you can see how things are evolving. We’re not happy with the production rate of today. And so, we’re asking chat gpt to help us create more and more. We need to have a say about everything, which is impossible for humans, so we train an AI model to help us have more opinions, say more things and increase our odds at riding a wave, any wave.

## Personal Branding: When the Means Become the Ends

I struggle professionally. Nothing to hide here. My career is squiggly and I’m not the companies’ ideal profile. So I’m not trying to belittle the success of those who use personal branding to their favor. I simply notice things.

We used to live in a world where people with certain expertise provided their services to the market at a certain price. To market their services, people had to achieve some results, aim at building long-term relationships with valuable clients and overall improve their craft so that their odds of success increase.

Instead of putting expertise at the center of service success, today we put personal branding. There’s a plethora of courses out there that teach people how to be “thought leaders” regarding topics they know little to nothing about. And even if you know a thing or two, a core pillar of personal branding is publishing consistently. And no one is capable of publishing valuable content almost daily to keep pace with the personal branding plan. An easy solution to this would be to always talk about the trend or to skim a topic and try to summarize your skimmed ideas into a succinct carousel on LinkedIn. You see it everyday now. People who publish consistently and always talk get rewarded somehow, either by getting into the business of training or getting a job at a big company or even monetizing their reach.

You might have good intentions. You may say that you’ll use personal branding to get more deals, but you’ll keep developing your expertise too. I saw this happening with people who already have a solid clientele; where they use the insights they learn from having “skin in the game” to market themselves even more. Other than that, personal branding seems to be evolving into a full-time job.

This leads us to one of the biggest contradictories of personal branding. While, by definition, personal branding is branding the unique abilities of a human being, more and more we lean towards using AI tools to do it. This markets nothing special about the person and it says nothing about the human behind it. Well, because there isn’t one.

## The Subtle Art of Stupefying Humans

Years ago I read the book How to Speak and How to listen by Mortimer Adler. One of its appendices was a talk he gave, arguing that computers won’t become as intelligent as humans. I don’t remember if it was from the book, or it came from my mind that while maybe computers won’t be as intelligent as us, humans have a tendency to become dumper, if the context is well-suited.

I can’t disregard that so many things signal that we’re heading towards such direction. Replacing thoughtful interactions with mindless postings and expertise with shiny babbles are two clear examples on excatly that.
