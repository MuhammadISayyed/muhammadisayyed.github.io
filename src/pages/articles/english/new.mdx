I have this idea I want to build. It’s a tool for facilitating tone of voice guideline development. As a copywriter I struggled a lot to understand what TOV is, let alone developing it. After reading a few books, researching the web for authoritative people from whom I could learn how to do it, I’m at a place where I don’t find it hard anymore. Challenging, but not hard. Aspiring endeavor. Wish me luck. But there’s a problem.

I’m not actually building it. I’m still learning a simple tech stack that would enable me to build this. A long path that I’m very close to finish. I’m not seeking mastery or anything. But as you know, there’s a minimum to be acquired.

The last 2 weeks I’ve lived under the impression that I’ve an excuse to just learn. I didn’t have to worry about building, not for now. But then it struck me: a builder that’s not actively building isn’t a real builder. I know it sounds cliché, but it felt very real then. The thought flowed… A lack of a specific skill isn’t an excuse for not being actively involved in the act of building.

Some might say one doesn’t have to always be building to become a maker. I agree. But that’s not what I’m referring to here. I’m referring to the fact that one could live the illusion of building without actually building. I felt kinda indie hacker while studying Golang. I did a year ago when I’ve been learning React only to ditch it later for a simpler stack. For over a year now I’ve been improving my tech skillset. It felt like building. But it’s not remotely close.

I’m 28 years old. I’m dreaming of becoming an indie maker since I was 20. For the past 8 years I studied my ass off for a lot of things: my marketing career, tech stack (on and off) and many other things that I won’t bore you with. But along these years I didn’t feel far from becoming a maker. It felt that eventually something would click and I’ll find myself there.

This why a separation between learning and building is needed. As a maker, you won’t stop improving your skillset. It’s in your blood. The more you learn the wider your opportunities array becomes. It’s a beautiful thing. But it shouldn’t feel like building. If it does, it becomes wicked, a barrier that stands between you and becoming a builder. Or in the terms of Luca Dellanna, it becomes a proxy.

If we treat learning and building separately, learning more won’t signal building, it’d simply mean widening our opportunities array. On the other hand, we’ll remove the biggest block stopping us from building. You won’t be waiting to finish that 280-ish lessons course to build something. You know that building is akin to a muscle that you need to train day in and day out. It doesn’t matter if you’re building via the latest technology or using a simple spreadsheet. Heck, it doesn’t matter if it makes money or not. There’s an intrinsic value to exploring a problem, discovering different solutions and offering our sincerest effort to the world. This is what a maker does. And down the road, one gets rewarded with money, status or maybe happiness. We’ll see…

On a related note, I’ve a hunch that learning in this fashion could be subconsciously intentional and its effects are detrimental. Few people will relate to what I’m trying to say here. But did you ever feel like you’re suffering from trying too hard? It doesn’t matter if the effort is necessary or not. You do it because you’re hooked to a vicious cycle that insinuates that to succeed you’ve to exert incredible effort. You see someone building a simple app and making money of it and you go, I need to study harder to build something even better. You feel like they’re lucky because they didn’t exert that much effort into building their successful app. Ew, luck I don’t need that. What a tricky little fucker! If you relate to any of this, you’re adopting a harmful worldview that’s costing you a lot both on the short term and on the long term. Free yourself.
